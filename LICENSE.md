## The Fine Print

### Ownership
You're buying a license to use this, not the template itself. I still own it, but you can use it under these terms.

### Credits
Not required, but appreciated! If you want to give a shoutout:
```
Built with STUDIO by Lutte Studio
```

### Support
You get 6 months of support - bug fixes, updates, and help with the docs

### Refunds
Digital products are tricky. Refunds follow UI8's policy, so check their terms before buying.

### Updates
Free updates forever. If there's a major new version, you might get a discount to upgrade.
